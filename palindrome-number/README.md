## Task

Given an integer `x` return `true` if `x` is a palindrome integer.

An integer is a `palindrome` when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

Sample input:

```
x = 121
```

Sample output:

```
true
```

Sample input:

```
x = -121
```

Sample output:

```
false
// From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left
// it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
