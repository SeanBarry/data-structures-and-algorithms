## Task

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

Sample input:

```
string =  = "abaxyzzyxf"
```

Sample output:

```
"xyzzyx"
```
