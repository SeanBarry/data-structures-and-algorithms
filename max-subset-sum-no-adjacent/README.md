## Task

Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array.

If the input array is empty, the function should return `0`.

Sample input:

```
array = [75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]
```

Sample output:

```
330
// 75 + 120 + 135
```
