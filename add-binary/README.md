Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

Sample Input:

```
a = "1010", b = "1011"
```

Sample Output:

```
"10101"
```

Constraints:

`1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`

`a` and `b` consist only of `0` or `1` characters.

Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
