## Task

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Sample input:

```
nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
```

Sample Output:

```
[4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Sample input 2:

```
nums = [1]
```

Sample Output 2:

```
1
```
