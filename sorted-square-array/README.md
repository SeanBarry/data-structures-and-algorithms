# Space Time Complexity

**Average** O(N) time | O(N) space

where:

N is the length of the input array

---

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

Sample Input:

```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

Sample Output:

```
[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]
```
