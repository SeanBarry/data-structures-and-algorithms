# Radix Sort

## Space Time Complexity

**Average** O(d \* (n + b)) time | O(n + b) space

where:

n is the length of the array

b is the base of the numbering system used

d is the max number of digits (e.g. biggest value in array is 53645 - 5 digits)

## Task

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Radix Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Sample Input:

`[8762, 654, 3008, 345, 87, 65, 234, 12, 2]`

Sample Output:

`[2, 12, 65, 87, 234, 345, 654, 3008, 8762]`
