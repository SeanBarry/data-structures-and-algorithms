## Space Time Complexity

**Best**

O(N) time | O(1) space

where:

N is the length of the input array

**Average**

O(N) time | O(1) space

where:

N is the length of the input array

**Worst**

O(N^2) time | O(1) space

where:

N is the length of the input array

## Task

Write a function that takes in an array of distinct integers as well as an integer `k` and that returns the kth smallest integer in that array.

The function should do this in linear time, on average.

Sample input:

```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 7, 6, 3]
k = 3
```

Sample output:

```
5
```
