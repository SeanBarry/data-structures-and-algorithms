A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Sample Input:

```
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
```

Sample Output:

```
true // "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

Sample Input 2:

```
s = "race a car"
```

Sample Output 2:

```
false // "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`

- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
