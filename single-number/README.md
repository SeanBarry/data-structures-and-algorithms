# Single Number

## Space Time Complexity

O(N) time | O(1) space

## Task

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Sample input:

```
nums = [2,2,1]
```

Sample output:

```
1
```

Sample input 2:

```
nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
```

Sample output 2:

```
4
```
