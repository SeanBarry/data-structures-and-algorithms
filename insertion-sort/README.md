Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Sample Input:

`[8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]`

Sample Output:

`[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]`

Insertion sort works by creating a 'sorted' list at the start of the array, and as it iterates through the 'unsorted' list, finding the correct position for the value in the 'sorted' list by comparing it to the previous value. If it's lower, then swap the positions.
